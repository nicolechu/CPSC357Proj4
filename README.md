#### Purpose
Allow a user to adjust background color of app using red, blue, green, and alpha sliders or inputs.  They may save these colors for further use, such as displaying the color, sharing the color, or deleting the color.


#### I/O Description
A splash screen with a paintbrush and app name appears when the user opens the app.  Then, a page will open on the user's iOS device with red, blue, and green sliders and inputs.  These values will initiate at color value 255 with a white background.  As a user adjusts sliders or input values, the background will adjust to match color value.  Additionally, there is a slider and input meant for the alpha value, which alters the darkness of the color.  A user may save the color values for later reuse on a collections page, and select saved colors to automatically adjust to.  To load a saved color, the user may click on the color.  To share or delete the color, they may perform a long press and a window will pop up.  If they choose to delete the color, it disappears immediately.  If they choose to share the color, a window will appear with various sharing options.

#### Run Instructions
Please run on iPhone 11, as this was tested and designed on this version.
